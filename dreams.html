     <h1 class="dreamh1">My Ambition</h1>
     <p class="dreamp">Since I was a kid I always dreamed of being an programmer
         and once I grew up,I started learning coding by myself.
         I worked hard for the past 2 years learning about <strong>IT</strong> itself,it's history and everything I wondered about.
         I learned about <strong>Hardwares</strong>,what they are and what they do,also how to fix them.
         Then I learned about <strong>System Administration</strong>.After that I learned about <strong>Networking</strong>.
         But I really didn't find myself there,and always looked up to programming.
         So,the next step was to learn <strong>HTML CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.I really like spending my time coding even if it's just a little bit or to much.
         So basically,now I am ready to be a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>.But I really that within the next 5 years I become a <strong>Senior Full-Stack Developer</strong>.
         And after I've become what I said right now,I will start learning and programming about the thing that I always wanted to do since a kid,
         and that is to become an <strong>Game Developer</strong>.This was my dream since a kid and I will try everything to make it a reality.
         I also love learning how to create <strong>APK,Games,Social Medias</strong>,etc.
